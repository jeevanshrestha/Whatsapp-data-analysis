[9/7/2024, 5:41:01 pm] Ajay Sati: Hey everyone, Ajay Sati this side, your tutor.

 Believe me, guys, no matter your background, you can break into the data field if you have the right set of skills, some wonderful projects, and the technique of selling yourself to recruiters. There are ample job openings in the market, and they will keep on growing with time. We just have to make sure that we have the apt skills. But by skills, I don't mean just knowing things. Most aspirants know the concepts, but only 4-5% know how to use those concepts effectively. Everyone lacks the industrial implications of the concepts they have learned. Focus on real-world applications, work on meaningful projects, and develop a strong portfolio. Remember, the key to hiring  is not just knowledge but also the ability to apply that knowledge in practical, impactful ways. Companies can go for people who know less concepts but know how to apply the things than rather then the one who knows everything but dont know how to apply a single of them.
Concepts can be taught but logics( i call them magics), mindset need to be build.
data field exists  because the data hold very very deep secrets in it . Once we have mindset to un-cover those secrets, you can do wonders.
The greatest analytical tool we have is our Brain.
Let's keep pushing forward and sharpening our skills, and you'll see the opportunities open up for you.

[9/7/2024, 5:55:06 pm] ~ revamp_study: Sir can you help us to crack job also bcos many companies doesn't allow fresher
[9/7/2024, 6:02:17 pm] ~ Ruben Varghese: PowerBI “Advance Editor” is in the syllabus ?

It helps in leveraging chatgpt for the analysis

[9/7/2024, 6:11:24 pm] Ajay Sati: With the course you will learn this.

Hi guys, this is Akarsh. I'm currently working in non tech but trying to transition into the data field.

I was busy with UPSC exams(cleared a few) but interviews didn't turn out in my favour so I wasn't aware about the data field but one thing stuck with me that "data is the new fuel" and tried learning things from here and there since the past 1.5 years but to no avail. I recently came across Nitish sir's DSMP 1 and that really gave me a lot of clarity about the field.

I hope to learn a lot from the course and the people around here. I'd be happy to connect with you all on LinkedIn.

[11/7/2024, 8:54:17 am] ~ Rishab: I have a quick question 
In the first session Ajay sir had mentioned that Data Analyst will see check the data feasibility and data collection 

I have also seen that Power BI handles a lot of ETL

But isn’t that the work of a Data Engineer 
They would typically find data from relevant sources and then Perform ETL using Airflow and store them to relevant data warehouse Like RDS or Snowflake

Then Data Analyst will take the data from warehouse and provide insights and do some extra ETL if needed

Am I correct with this assumption? Or is there an overlap between the two roles? 
Or is the industry standard not clear in diving the roles into their respective categories? ‎<This message was edited>
[11/7/2024, 9:50:19 am] ~ Harry: Hey Rishab
Sometimes as a data analyst you may have to perform ETL. It totally depends on your role and company’s workflow.
I know a few analysts in startup’s who act as hybrid data engineers and analysts

Data Industry is a vast industry, person entering into this field should have a knowledge of all the things.

Work in a data industry u can't segregate by a tall wall which says ki job role behind this wall is yours this side is mine.

My request to all is that don't sepnt your valuable time in knowing that which role is doing what.

Learn the skill.

Sharp your skill.

Prepare yourself like you can do anything in this industry.

Regards
Rajni Kant

However I would suggest having  this  competition after we are done with the course , so that the one who knows nothing about power Bi Or knows only basics about power bi can also participate in it.

In this way we can have a  competition that involves everyone.....

The current project I'm working in TCS is not I find worth working in , So I was thinking to switch but couldn't find companies who are open for the tech I work it's kind of obsolete. 

Hey folks , need your help to learn data analytics atleast at that level so that I could make up to some good companies. 

Please feel free to guide me , I might be sounding like newbie but that's is it.

Thanks,

Who are  free on weekends only...

Moreover we want to give more time to you all so that from your end you can build solid business mindset, logics etc through introspection and self knowledge.

However we will still try to figure out if increasing classes are possible or not.

*No career related or other relevant questions will be taken during class( on weekends)*

You can keep those questions and we will discuss everything in detail  in doubt sessions.
 
In doubt sessions you can  come up with any type of questions however in class we will focus on academic(curriculum ) related questions only......

Be assured your no questions will be left un-answered(be it related to anything) However in class we will focus more on course and learning  questions and less on other questions

We all are excited to learn more ..
[12/7/2024, 7:30:05 pm] ~ Pratik: Hi All, 
I have been a silent listener to this group. And I want to say something after hearing all your queries and concerns. I am not an expert but still hear me out.

I am a data scientist with 4.5 years of experience working in a leading product based company based out of France. During my initial days into data science when I used to search out for solution and I found campusx. Trust me guys when I am saying this, I have gone through a lot of you tube channel and also course from Upgrad and Simplilearn. Nitish sir stands out on quality compared to all the materials that I have visited till date. So there is no question of doubt on the content being provided. I also have experience on power for 2 years and just wanted to gain the theoretical knowledge therefore I joined this course. 

I saw concerns of people being from different background, will they be able to learn the skill or not. I have been an average student throughout my career, and if I am able to do well, you guys will shine. It will just take a bit of hard work and determination . Don’t ever be afraid of being left out on being from different background. Trust me, whatever we have learned during our graduation and post graduation is totally different from what we work in industry. So we all are on the same page. 

So please don’t doubt and show any concern about what will you achieve out of this course. The quality and quantity that we all are getting via campusx is unmatchable at the the price that we are paying. This is nothing. 

Just trust the process and be calm for 3 months. Post queries on doubts related to skills. I know this group is matured enough to help each and every one out. 

At the end, if you have any concern with the job opening, you guys can reach out to me. I can only refer you in limited quantity but post that it’s your skills and knowledge that will get you through.

Forgive me if I unknowingly hurt someone’s sentiment. Just thought of sharing this. 

Regards
Pratik

[12/7/2024, 11:20:55 pm] Ajay Sati: For a data analyst.
You must know probability , basic statistics,  distributions , skewness,  hypothesis testing, a little bit of airthemaric,
[12/7/2024, 11:23:55 pm] Ajay Sati: But I generally suggest learn calculus also  as with calculus you will be able to  learn basic ML Algorithms (supervised and unsupervised) . Learning these things will give you an upper edge..

Consider two people working as data analyst. One is knowing clustering algorithms and other don't.

First one who knows clustering algorithms can give clusters of the potential customers  to the company , this will give him/her an upper edge...

A retail company has been experiencing fluctuations in its monthly sales performance. The management wants to understand the factors contributing to these variations. They need a detailed report highlighting key performance metrics, customer purchasing trends, and seasonal impacts over the past two years. Who should handle this task, a data analyst or a business analyst?
[13/7/2024, 1:00:16 am] Ajay Sati: ‎POLL:
Who will?
‎OPTION: Data analyst (63 votes)
‎OPTION: Business analyst (5 votes)
[13/7/2024, 1:02:54 am] ~ Mitesh Sah: Both data analysts and business analysts can contribute to this task, but the primary responsibility would fall on the data analyst. Here's why:

Data Analyst:

- Responsible for extracting, processing, and analyzing large datasets to identify trends and patterns.
- Skilled in statistical analysis, data visualization, and data mining techniques.
- Can analyze sales data, customer demographics, and market trends to identify correlations and insights.

Business Analyst:

- Focuses on understanding business needs and processes, identifying opportunities for improvement, and implementing solutions.
- May not have the same level of technical expertise in data analysis as a data analyst.
- Can provide context and insights on business operations, market dynamics, and customer behavior, but may rely on the data analyst for in-depth data analysis.

Collaboration:

- The data analyst would handle the data analysis, creating visualizations and reports to highlight key performance metrics, customer purchasing trends, and seasonal impacts.
- The business analyst would provide input on business context, help interpret the results, and ensure the findings align with business objectives.

In summary, the data analyst would lead the analysis, and the business analyst would provide support and context to ensure the insights are actionable and relevant to the business.

[15/7/2024, 1:46:26 am] ~ Pratik: The way the session is being conducted is not that I was expecting after how Nitish sir has delivered DSMP. The team should look into how to make the session more productive. It’s not necessary to answer these basic questions as most of us are at least graduate. 
Participant should also understand that they won’t be provided hand holding. 

I hope Nitish sir and team will take better measures from next session onwards to make this course more engaging.

Moreover we have doubt session also on Wednesday

[15/7/2024, 1:54:54 am] ~ TomatoPotato: What about our time ?
[15/7/2024, 1:54:57 am] ~ Harry: I love what Prateek brought up. I fear at this speed we are going to not get the most out of the course. Ajay is a very good instructor and his empathetic nature is being miss used here. 
I hope this feedback from Prateek is taken constructively as I feel if we plan to grow in this industry we have to be autonomous and eager to learn and not require simple concepts to be repeated several times
[15/7/2024, 1:54:59 am] ~ Mohit Dhillon: Yeah, we need to motivate trainer. If we want some changes in course, we can let him know and I am sure he will listen to it

If anyone has, techincal doubts put it infront of him rather than directly questioning his teaching style.

[15/7/2024, 11:30:24 am] Ajay Sati: Hello everyone,

For those experiencing differences in the user interface yesterday, it’s due to the new July version of Power BI. In this update, the method to edit the working area has changed: right-clicking is no longer required. Instead, you’ll find a direct formatting option on the right-hand side. Similarly, all visuals are now conveniently located on a panel on the right, rather than being accessed through the Insert or Home menu. While the functionality remains the same, the user interface has been streamlined. The additional steps of right-clicking to edit charts and navigating to the Insert menu to build visuals have been removed, making these options directly accessible on the screen.

I've updated my Power BI to the July version and I still have the same user interface (right-click is working for me, and I have the ribbon of visuals in the Home and Insert menus).

I request that everyone in India update their Power BI to the July version and let me know if you have the same interface as mine or a different one. People from other countries may have different interfaces due to regional issues, so this request is specifically for those in India.

To update Power BI, just download it again from the Power BI store and follow the necessary steps. Make sure to save your work somewhere (e.g., desktop, drive, etc.) before updating Power BI. ‎<This message was edited>

[15/7/2024, 4:58:43 pm] ~ khan Jaseem: Hey, Im using a MacBook and didn't find a way to download PowerBi 
Does anyone know this.
Or should I go for install windows on mac
[15/7/2024, 4:59:36 pm] ~ Rishab: That would be the best way to
Install VM and run windows to use BI
But it’s slow
[15/7/2024, 5:01:37 pm] ~ Manish Gupta: I also have Mac. We have to install parallels or similar software to install windows. However we need to check if powerbi can be installed on Mac with silicon chips
[15/7/2024, 5:04:54 pm] ~ khan Jaseem: I have m1 and we can have the PowerBi web app on Chrome but it is way different from PB Desktop.
[15/7/2024, 5:05:35 pm] ~ Sinha Ji: that’s the only way.
[15/7/2024, 5:05:51 pm] ~ Manish Gupta: That is PowerBI services. For PowerBI desktop, you need to install it.
[15/7/2024, 5:06:27 pm] ~ khan Jaseem: Yep I'm installing a VM
[15/7/2024, 5:06:36 pm] ~ khan Jaseem: Thanks

[15/7/2024, 5:42:09 pm] ~ .: i was just confirming.
[15/7/2024, 5:44:19 pm] Ajay Sati: Hello everyone,

Some of you are experiencing differences in the Power BI interface, even though we all have the same version installed. This discrepancy is due to Power BI automatically enabling or disabling certain features based on your specific Windows version, system configurations, and processor capabilities.

To resolve this, I am currently investigating the exact settings that need to be adjusted. I’m working closely with a few students from this group who are facing this interface issue to identify the necessary changes.

By the end of the day, I will share a detailed video tutorial outlining the steps you need to follow to align your Power BI interface with mine(the setting that need to be changed) This will ensure that we all have a consistent experience moving forward.

Thank you.

Using  appropriate colour palette is important as reporting is highly visual. For people who would like to improve on this aspect, this 10 min video is more than enough to understand the basics, it helped me a lot I must say.

Hello everyone! The doubt session is just a few hours away. Those who have doubts  please ask your doubts over here  and we will then discuss them in the class.
I would also request that if any  doubt that  you are having is already asked by someone, no need to type that doubt again rather than you can  upvote the doubt (by clicking on the thumbs-up button on the right hand side of the doubt asked )


feel free to ask any doubts.
career related doubts will also be taken. ‎<This message was edited>

It will give you a good picture and moreover save your money too.

However I generally don't prefer using this option , if I have to show multiple  data on same graph I go for tooltip or put both the columns on the same axis( y axis)

I hope all are doing great..

Guys before attempting any problem of the  assignment , I want you all to study the dataset first.
You all are working as a data analyst now..
Understanding of data is very very must , half of the relationship, logics , problem generations are solved while you understand the data.

Try to  understand what data is all about , what each column show, is there any hierarchy In any columns ,  are columns having any relationship with between  them , try to analyze these things first and then jump to the assessment questions.
Believe me while spending time on the dataset, I guarantee you will be able to solve half of the problems.

[23/7/2024, 2:00:35 pm] ~ .: Sir in Mail 2, “In 2016, the company set a 5-year target to achieve an overall sales goal of $25 million and a profit goal of $10 million by the end of 2020. According to this plan, by the end of 2019, the company should have reached a sales target of $20 million. This equates to approximately $1.7 million in sales per month(collectively) from 2016 to 2019.As the company is far beyond the target to be achieved, the company is now interested in seeing for each month collectively (2016-2019) fluctuations of our sales performance from the target help company visualize this Company is also interested in seeing a visual of how far they are from the set profit target.”
I think the company should achieve approximately $1.7 million in sales per month collectively from 2016 to 2019 is incorrect. Is this just a dummy number of correct calculation if it is not for example then The correct Calculation should be 

The correct monthly target is around $416,667.
From 2016 to 2019 ,there are 4 years , 4*12=  48           
Now 20,000,000 /48=$416,667  
Kindly correct me
[23/7/2024, 2:06:39 pm] Ajay Sati: $416667 is per month sales


However we need collective sales for all years.

Eg - if I am saying January , it means sales of January 2026,2017,2018,2019.


The above value($416667) is of 1 month of January we need to multiply it with 4 to get the collective amount for January.

$416,667*4  gives 1666666 

So I approximated  it to  1.7million. ‎<This message was edited>

The Business Analyst team has also tasked you with visualising the total sales and quantity sold over the years categorised by different reseller types.

load the retailor dataset  and invest some time in understanding the data, try to see if there is any column that tell the retailor type as our question is asking for a visual with retailor type.

take few minutes to read and understand the new data, try to relate the sales data and reseller data and see if two tables connect and if you are able to find the reseller type.

try it from your end first , i have given you the hint.
if not able to solve , ping again , I will help you out.

[24/7/2024, 2:00:26 am] Ajay Sati: Hey everyone
I am getting many messages , some of you are facing difficulties in understanding the  home assignment question, judging the questions and deciding the course of action. 


- read dataset first.
- then  read question.
- then go to dataset and mark which columns the problem will need.
- then try with all possible visual or course of action.
- once you try with all possible visuals or course of action , choose the one that best show  what client is asking , while choosing the visual keep a thing in mind that the information that client need should be clearly displayed.
- try this approach , build visuals with this , in beginning you will face difficulties and it will consume time , but this is best way to learn.

try these steps, and in this entire process you will not only explore things but also get to know eventually what suits best for  a particular problem.

if after following all these all steps , you still get no result, you can reach out to me.
but before I answer , I will ask what process you followed and what though of mind you  choose to solve this problem.

[24/7/2024, 2:43:39 am] ~ Pranav: is Ctrt + click the only option to clear slices and to call a bookmark or it can be done by just clicking. I'm think from clients POV as they might not know they have to click on ctrl
[24/7/2024, 2:43:53 am] Ajay Sati: this is version issue .

right click  after placing your   cursor on the  quaterr ,  you will get drill option over there

1. For example for my first page, I created the visuals and then chose a theme. If I am making visuals on the second page, can I use a different theme? I chose one theme for my first page, and when I started making visuals on the second page, it automatically used the same theme. When I change the theme on the second page, the theme on the first page also changes.

2. While creating a filled map, if the client hasn't provided specific rules and we are choosing the colors ourselves, can we use legends in the visuals to indicate which colors represent different value ranges?

[25/7/2024, 11:23:50 pm] ~ Harry: Hey @918193802178 
I prepare a report using excel worksheet that connects data from different sources. A few of the sheets take data from a sql table using power query.
Will it be a good idea to use this excel Sheet as a source file for a power BI dashboard?

I wish to refresh this dashboard as my sql tables are refreshed everyday.

What would be a good workflow if I have the excel worksheet connected to a few sql tables and is refreshed everyday (manually)also this file is now my input data for power bi and I want this dashboard to refresh everytime I refresh my excel file.
[25/7/2024, 11:24:04 pm] ~ Mukesh Bhatt: Can you let me know from where i have to change this setting?
[25/7/2024, 11:29:38 pm] Ajay Sati: Hey everyone ,I won't be available till 11 pm tomorrow due to  some personal reasons.

This  power BI course is unique and different from others because here students work together for the upliftment of others...


I know you all are cooperative, I request all of you to keep this cooperative skills high and help each other's out in  doubts....
[25/7/2024, 11:31:42 pm] ~ Arvind: Many of companies using different sql servers not excel
[25/7/2024, 11:32:39 pm] ~ Arvind: Because excel have limitations and slow

total sales and quantity sold over the years categorised by different
reseller types. They are interested in understanding how sales and
quantities have evolved annually across various types of resellers.
This visualisation will provide insights into the performance trends of
each reseller type over time, helping to identify which types contribute
most significantly to sales and quantity sold annually.

[26/7/2024, 7:19:14 pm] ~ $ID: Hi,
Was able to fix the issue 
For that followed the following steps

1. Saved the file again using save as: type: CSV
2. Then imported it - selected transform data option
3. Then right clicked on the column : Split column - by delimeter - delimiter: tab , split at: each occurence quote character: none 
4. Then to make the row 1 as headers used use first row as headers.
5. Close and apply
[26/7/2024, 7:20:47 pm] ~ $ID: Also before doing this one thing that needs to be done is there were few values that were in different columns so I used space (as tab was not being accepted as delimiter as it navigated to next cell) pasted it in the column 1 itself

Good morning sir 
Can you please share the .exe file of your power bi version? 
Actually the version that you are currently using is I believe from dec 2023 and the version that is available on the official website is of June 2024. The interface is sort of different in both the version because of which whenever you share something I have to do some digging in order to find that option or that feature and hence it kills a valuable amount of time as well.
It will be best if I can stay on the same version that you are using so kindly if possible please share the .exe file of power bi  that you are using or if there is any other way to get that respective version then let me know. 
Thank you

[27/7/2024, 6:08:37 pm] ~ Sufal: @13135550002 Can we link Google sheets directly to power bi
[27/7/2024, 6:08:38 pm] Meta AI: Yes, you can link Google Sheets directly to Power BI. Power BI offers a Google Sheets connector that allows you to import data from Google Sheets into Power BI.

Here are the steps to connect Google Sheets to Power BI:

1. Open Power BI and click on "Get Data" in the Home tab.
2. Select "Google Sheets" from the list of available connectors.
3. Enter the URL of your Google Sheet or select it from your Google Drive account.
4. Authenticate with your Google account to authorize Power BI to access your Google Sheet.
5. Select the specific sheet and range of data you want to import.
6. Click "Load" to import the data into Power BI.

Once connected, you can use Power BI to visualize and analyze your Google Sheets data, and even schedule regular refreshes to keep your data up-to-date.

Note: Make sure your Google Sheet is set to "Anyone with the link can view" or "Anyone with the link can edit" to allow Power BI to access the data. ‎<This message was edited>

I request everyone to kindly do rigorous  practise of Dax that we have learned till now , try to form your questions, try different scenarios on the question given.



The more you try these DAX , the more you will be confident with logic and syntax.....

Believe me if you master these  DAX only that we have covered till today.

You can form very very complex logics...

Everyone please give your entire week in masters the 10-15 DAX that we learned.

[30/7/2024, 3:56:18 pm] ~ anil: @918193802178, drill through is filtering. So, when we apply drill through (let's suppose using Quarter)and then we apply drill through (let's suppose using Year). So, will second drill through will work on top of first drill through? Also, is there a way where by we can be confirmed ki drill through kis pe laga hai?
[30/7/2024, 5:19:48 pm] ~ Bilal Ahmed: 1st drill through will show all quarters of all years combined(16,17,18,19) 

And 2nd drill through will show quarters of a particular selected year (19, if this is selected.) 

Am I right, someone please let me know🙏🏽
[30/7/2024, 5:25:01 pm] ~ $ID: Hi guys,
Just had a quick doubt 
I found a set of questions and dataset (for practicing dax) 

Q.1 Total number of cards issued by American Express

For which I wrote a measure like
American Express Issuer =
CALCULATE (
COUNT('Table_Name'[Card Type Full name]),
FILTER(TABLENANE, TABLENANE[Issuing Bank] = "American Express"))

I got the count as 58K , just to cross check in the table view I just applied the filter for issuing bank to America express and there I saw the count was 58,403 (403 rows were not displayed in my measure).
The type of measure was set to whole number

[30/7/2024, 5:27:44 pm] ~ $ID: So my question was @918193802178 
does Power BI round off to the closest range value
Like here the total count was 58,403 so it rounded off to 58K 

If the value had been 
58,606 then it would have choosen the closest ceiling value like 59K ‎<This message was edited>

[30/7/2024, 6:06:05 pm] Ajay Sati: No , second drill through will first remove the drill through selection of first drill through and then act.


Drill through are selections of one page that act as filter on another page.

So when second drill through(second selection) will act ,  it will first remove the filter that was applied to the reporting page when we drilled through the first selection  and then show the result of second drill through.

.
2- Page whose setting is changed to drill through will only pop up when you choose to drill.
[30/7/2024, 6:11:38 pm] Ajay Sati: yes , However you can choose the show the decimal point values by changing the decimal to be displayed  via formatting  >>>> callout value >>>value decimal places

[2/8/2024, 5:53:44 pm] ~ $ID: Good afternoon @918193802178  and @918420166148 Sir,
Just wanted to ask this:
In this course we will covering all the topics related to Power BI as an analysis tool, till now we have covered the visuals, basic steps in DA, roles of BA and DA, Difference in Tableau vs BI and last week Ajay Sir covered basic DAX queries and this week we will start with Advance DAX queries.
Along with this will it be possible 😉 have one slight addition which is preparation for job roles in Power BI (be it for a fresher or an experienced candidate who might be working in different domain and want to shift in this Data Analysis field), interview preparation (Sir do mention some interview questions during the class), applying for the roles and much more.
As after the course ends we might not be in regular contact with you both (work priorities and you also might be busy) 
So will it be possible to have a placement support for this course as well wherein you can guide us in job application process and the preparation (although this was not mentioned in the course like you have for DSMP 2.0) but if this is possible it will be of great benefit. ‎<This message was edited>

As we progress through the PowerBI course, can we take a session on interview questions after the session 10 with the syllabus covered so far?
This would help us consolidate our learning and better prepare for the interview at the same time.

Within the session we are covering interview questions as per topics..

For each topic covered I am side by side covering  interview questions as well as sharing the tips and tricks or things that need to be considered while working in industry or working giving interview..


Rest we have session for interview questions at the end.
There we will cover more questions..

[4/8/2024, 9:01:28 pm] ~ Sumit: Yes @918193802178, you are covering the interview questions in each sessions but I believe there should be one centralised registry where all the questions will be consolidated to quickly revise before the interview. Yes, we have one session at the end of course, but one session based on the topic covered so far in the middle will be very helpful before approaching the course to an end. Just a feedback.

I have updated your assignment document. We have completed up to Mail 6, and your new assignment questions are from Mail 7.

Moreover,  additional datasets have been provided to you, which will be needed to solve the questions.

[5/8/2024, 2:48:57 pm] Ajay Sati: Yes they both will give the same  value.

However certain DAX such as rankx ,  don't accepts columns as inputs . They take measures only.


So for such  cases we have created sales measure.
[5/8/2024, 2:59:09 pm] ~ @N!K€T: Okay sir.

Q2 exactly what do we have to find, because in the target table we have 3 columns I'd, target (numeric) and the date.
In the question the example mentions if an employee complete the target in week 2,3,4 then a apply formula else what should be done 
Do we have a column to check when an employee completed the target?

[8/8/2024, 12:16:36 am] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: I think you need to extract week day first from date part and then apply formula
[8/8/2024, 1:27:12 am] ~ $ID: Like from the target column extract the week and then apply formula?
[8/8/2024, 1:58:31 am] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: You need to check for two conditions 
1: check if target is achieved 
2: check if it's in week 2,3,4
You don't need to extract week separately, it can be nested within the formula you'll apply

As in Target dataset table we can only get an idea of the employee id, target and the target month.

Correct me do we need to Target month with current day if it's a match then check it's week?
[8/8/2024, 4:24:02 pm] ~ $ID: Otherwise how can we check the two conditions

[8/8/2024, 5:44:44 pm] ~ Milind: Try putting only < only in formula instead of <=>
[8/8/2024, 5:45:33 pm] ~ monikak: Yes I did same but not working
[8/8/2024, 5:49:07 pm] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: You can check two conditions using AND and IF function
e.g = IF(AND(10 > 9, -10 < -1), "All true", "One or more false")
[8/8/2024, 6:23:01 pm] ~ $ID: Ok could you also check my other response
[8/8/2024, 6:23:06 pm] ~ $ID: This
[8/8/2024, 6:26:48 pm] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: You can get week number using weeknum() function from the same table
[8/8/2024, 7:06:14 pm] ~ $ID: Ok so I assume that my understanding is right.
One last thing if it's not in week 2,3,4 then what should be done (if the target gets completed in week 1 then?)
[8/8/2024, 7:42:15 pm] ~ Mukesh Bhatt: Can anyone help me in this question?
Mail 7 - 2 question
The company aims to accurately assess the percentage of time each employee is achieving their assigned targets.
 For instance, consider Employee A, who is assigned weekly targets for a duration of four weeks. If Employee A successfully meets the targets in weeks 2, 3, and 4, but not in week 1, the calculation of their target fulfilment percentage would (3/4)*100
[8/8/2024, 7:45:39 pm] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: Then put "" (empty double quotes) at the end of if()
[8/8/2024, 9:33:03 pm] ~ $ID: Ok will check that
‎[8/8/2024, 9:43:52 pm] ~ Arvind: ‎image omitted
[8/8/2024, 9:48:27 pm] ~ Arvind: Sir @918193802178 reply
[8/8/2024, 9:51:59 pm] Ajay Sati: remove the last value , date[year] that is extra over here
[8/8/2024, 9:54:03 pm] Ajay Sati: for different different months , different  target is given , you have to check what was the total number of time an employee achived the target  that was given to him.

hint- target from trget table , actual performance in sales table
[8/8/2024, 9:55:05 pm] ~ $ID: Will check this
[8/8/2024, 9:55:19 pm] Ajay Sati: are you trying ot find the cumuliative sales of month ?
[8/8/2024, 9:55:33 pm] ~ Milind: Thanks. Working now.
[8/8/2024, 9:57:21 pm] Ajay Sati: Less than , greater than conditions dont work with text data, 
 your month column is text data.
[8/8/2024, 9:58:32 pm] ~ monikak: Yes
[8/8/2024, 9:58:42 pm] ~ $ID: Sir in Target table we are provided with employee id and in sales we have key.
So in Target table do we need to extract appropriate employee key from sales person in Target table (as a new column) and then check the total sales target for each month for employees?
[8/8/2024, 9:59:22 pm] ~ monikak: But now it's working i converted the month in numerical format and then find cumulative sum
[8/8/2024, 10:00:36 pm] ~ monikak: Yes got it thank you
[8/8/2024, 10:01:42 pm] Ajay Sati: 1 to many - when one row of table A is connected to many rows   rows of table B , they are one to many ( table A students details , table B subject details ,a single student can have many subjects)

many to many  - for both the tables many rows are  interconnected.
if a single student can take up many subjects , similiarly a single subject can be taken by multiple studenrts
[8/8/2024, 10:03:12 pm] Ajay Sati: you can use any approach , but we have to just see that for a particular employee is target met or not and we only have  link between two tables in the form od key.

so yes it will be used to find the sales of a particular employee over  a partcular period
[8/8/2024, 10:03:17 pm] ~ Fighter: Ok which ER would you prefer as both are applicable to this example
[8/8/2024, 10:03:38 pm] Ajay Sati: didnt got you.
[8/8/2024, 10:04:13 pm] ~ Fighter: Now for Students and subject tables, both type of entity relationships are possible
[8/8/2024, 10:04:21 pm] ~ Arvind: Is this best example for 1 to many because subject may be same for different students
[8/8/2024, 10:04:23 pm] ~ Fighter: But you have to choose one among them
[8/8/2024, 10:04:32 pm] ~ Fighter: Which one would you choose
[8/8/2024, 10:06:52 pm] ~ Arvind: Only many to many is possible
[8/8/2024, 10:10:03 pm] ~ Arvind: Sir @918193802178 please
[8/8/2024, 10:19:06 pm] ~ Arvind: If we have two table with 1 to 1 relationship in live reports.

So we need to merge both table or continue with relationship, 

what is tha best method we need to use?
[8/8/2024, 10:19:40 pm] ~ Arvind: Any one have solution for my both questions, pls reply
[8/8/2024, 10:52:05 pm] Ajay Sati: Yes , now which to choose will depend on which type of problem you are solving.
[8/8/2024, 10:54:15 pm] Ajay Sati: If two tables are having a 1-1 relationship.
We don't need a second table  because each row corresponds to only 1 row in another table,.

It's better to combine these two tables to form a single row in 1 table.
It will save space for second table ...
@919828300073
[8/8/2024, 10:54:38 pm] ~ Arvind: Thanks
[8/8/2024, 10:54:40 pm] Ajay Sati: Didn't get your question..
[8/8/2024, 10:56:09 pm] ~ Arvind: I am asking student and subject example you tell in session,  It's good example for 1 to many relationship

[8/8/2024, 10:59:32 pm] Ajay Sati: You can take another example then.

Two tables 
1- product 
2- sales.

Now each product can be sold multiple times..
So in product table each table is having only 1 entry to product (it's description) however in sales a same product may be sold multiple times...
[8/8/2024, 11:00:42 pm] ~ Arvind: I know this is example for 1 to many but I am asking for students and subject
[8/8/2024, 11:01:23 pm] ~ Arvind: Is this example for 1 to many or many to many or both
[8/8/2024, 11:01:58 pm] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: One to many Example: University and student
A university can have many students but any student at a  time can be enrolled in only one university
[8/8/2024, 11:02:17 pm] ~ Arvind: Right
[8/8/2024, 11:02:42 pm] ~ Arvind: But student and subject not

[8/8/2024, 11:06:19 pm] ~ Arvind: I totally agree but if interviewer ask same question - WHICH RELATIONSHIP WE USE FOR STUDENT AND SUBJECT TABLE ? then what I need to reply
[8/8/2024, 11:07:04 pm] ~ Faisal Hayat: Some share the male respective to session 8
[8/8/2024, 11:07:48 pm] ~ Arvind: Thanks bro
[8/8/2024, 11:09:34 pm] Ajay Sati: Go for  many to many.
But before answering this ask interviewer about what kind of table are student and subjects 

Is it  data of few student's having distinct subject.

Or   it's data of students tht can have common subjects.
[8/8/2024, 11:10:29 pm] ~ Arvind: Thanks for clearing the doubt
[8/8/2024, 11:41:44 pm] ~ suryakantabarik: Is there any assignment given by Sir ?
[8/8/2024, 11:46:43 pm] Ajay Sati: Hi everyone,

[13/8/2024, 12:03:21 am] ~ Nizam: Not from assignment, it is from relative filter context where u calculated sales changed from base year, but when I'm trying to extract year from date column using year() it is not working correctly and when extracting using date_column_name.[year]  object(shown by u in lec-10) it is extracting correctly

[13/8/2024, 12:12:10 am] Ajay Sati: Inside Calculate year(column name) wont give the correct output that calculate function cant process proeperly (it consider it only a unit value)

however the column.year applies a filter

[13/8/2024, 5:49:09 pm] ~ Shalu Chauhan: Sir this is giving all blank ...I am really confused on the interaction of calculate and filters internal working is not really clear
[13/8/2024, 5:51:14 pm] ~ Ignite: Try without filter 🤔
[13/8/2024, 5:51:28 pm] Ajay Sati: It highlights and filters the data  point that we have selected and all visuals respond on that basis
[13/8/2024, 5:52:08 pm] Ajay Sati: it will be done without filter
[13/8/2024, 5:52:14 pm] ~ Shalu Chauhan: And also wht is the difference in writing orders[order date]. [Year] with filter as oppose dto writing just orders[order date]. [Year]
[13/8/2024, 5:53:01 pm] ~ Shalu Chauhan: How will we know this ...a lot of my queries are not working just because of this confusion
[13/8/2024, 5:53:31 pm] Ajay Sati: with filter keyword, it filters the data two times.
one on the row level and other  filteration filter does.
[13/8/2024, 5:54:18 pm] Ajay Sati: Use filter keyword only when we have conditions like gender = male , category = customer and for rest use without fiter
[13/8/2024, 5:55:48 pm] ~ Shalu Chauhan: Can you please take this up in the doubt scession more extensively
[13/8/2024, 5:56:00 pm] ~ Shalu Chauhan: Please sir
[13/8/2024, 6:00:29 pm] ~ Shubham: @917057093142
[13/8/2024, 6:00:33 pm] ~ Parikh Dhruv: in simple words ese samaj kin filter specific ke liye hai,  jab selectedvalue() use  karte hai tab who hamme pura column deta hai like 

2016
2017
2018
2019

but when u just want 2016 kin specific muje 2016 kin sales yaa profit yaa something chaieye tab ham filters use karenge kin specific 2016 bass ..
[13/8/2024, 6:02:40 pm] ~ Shalu Chauhan: I gotbthe use of selected value...the issue is direct filter and filter with the keyword filter are behaving very different which needs understanding of internal working
[13/8/2024, 6:32:10 pm] Ajay Sati: Understanding internal working will be too complex to understand.

However i will give you a crux of why these things are working differently , in tomorrow's doubt session.

we are working on it.

For then , I am sharing everyday PBIX file .
[13/8/2024, 11:08:17 pm] ~ Akarsh: Understood sir. But could you please tell which sign is missing so that I'm able to understand the DAX properly.
[13/8/2024, 11:09:28 pm] Ajay Sati: whats the question statement
[14/8/2024, 12:00:10 am] ~ anil: Qus: The CEO has requested a report showing the average daily sales
amount across all years (2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019).

In above question when we made a table visual, it was showing result as follows in the Power BI:
Power BI	
Year	Average Sales
2016	6190
2017	7376
2018	9356
2019	11813
Total	8659

However, the average for the four years is actually coming out to be 8683.75. 
Why is there a difference in the output given by table visual of the Power BI?

[14/8/2024, 12:03:14 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: If I add filter function to it. I get infinity values. I am not able to understand why i am getting different results
[14/8/2024, 12:03:22 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: Can anyone explain please
[14/8/2024, 12:08:08 am] ~ anil: Bro, what I am saying is:
Average Sales ka average actual me (6190+7376+9356+11813)/4 =8683.75 hai.

But, Power BI is showing this to be 8659. Ye bol raha hu mai.
[14/8/2024, 12:08:46 am] ~ Ignite: Divided by 0 means infinity na bro ?
[14/8/2024, 12:09:29 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: I get that bro but on adding filter function what is happening behind which leads to 0 value.
[14/8/2024, 12:10:21 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: If you see in this picture, i did not use filter function inside calculate function
[14/8/2024, 12:10:43 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: But over i did
[14/8/2024, 12:10:44 am] ~ Parikh Dhruv: ohh sorry
[14/8/2024, 12:10:46 am] ~ Ignite: It is taking only 2016 data from sales measure
[14/8/2024, 12:11:21 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: Yeah but why?
[14/8/2024, 12:12:28 am] ~ Ignite: Because of orders[order date ] = 2016
[14/8/2024, 12:12:40 am] ~ Ignite: So it will take only 2016 data
[14/8/2024, 12:15:40 am] ~ Ignite: Measure aggregate dynamically , if you apply filter then it will filter 2nd time

[14/8/2024, 12:18:28 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: So, if I am using filter function inside calculate function all previous filters plus the boolean expression, both are applied. Is that what you mean bro?
[14/8/2024, 12:18:36 am] ~ anil: ‎This message was deleted.
[14/8/2024, 12:18:49 am] ~ anil: Avg Daily Sales =

return

[14/8/2024, 12:18:54 am] ~ Ignite: Granularity?
[14/8/2024, 12:19:07 am] ~ Deepam-Personal: Lowest transaction valuea
[14/8/2024, 12:19:25 am] ~ Deepam-Personal: Maybe that would be the reason it is coming wrong
[14/8/2024, 12:19:46 am] ~ anil: This is the question:
The CEO has requested a report showing the average daily sales
amount across all years (2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019).
[14/8/2024, 12:21:06 am] ~ Deepam-Personal: See some vdos on context transitions.. you will get it.. what exactly i am trying to explain
[14/8/2024, 12:24:01 am] ~ Ignite: Measures already use filter based on the visuals for example sales measure shows all total values for years 2016, 2017, 2018 ,, if you want to calculate 2016 total sales value we use  calculate(sum(orders[sales], filter(orders, order[order date ].[year ] =2016 ... So the sales measure will calculate this all behind based on the visuals context
[14/8/2024, 12:24:32 am] ~ Vinay Mittal: @918193802178 sir can you please why on adding filter function giving different results although the boolean expression inside is same.

[14/8/2024, 12:28:31 am] ~ anil: Yes, this is average shown by Power BI. But take the on your own, average of (6190+7376+9356+11813)/4 =8683.73
[14/8/2024, 12:28:34 am] ~ anil: I am asking this because if we present this to client, he can cross-question how is average different? And if this is the case, how can we get the actual average value.

either you calculate actual average or  value shown by this visual
[14/8/2024, 1:02:47 am] Ajay Sati: when you are using filter key word it is filtering twice , this is the reason why itss giving fishy values
[14/8/2024, 1:04:36 am] Ajay Sati: Actual average will not be calculated in this way , 
actual average will be total sales / total number of days we made sale.

what you are doing is  you are calculating first average of each month and then average of these calculated values (average is being calculated two times)
[14/8/2024, 2:11:39 am] Ajay Sati: Those who are facing issue of (=) sign missing In recordings, please tell the day numbers of the recordings?


So that we can work on the issue. ‎<This message was edited>

from the sales values of other countries within the top 10. This
analysis will highlight the performance gap between the leading
country and its peers, offering insights into potential areas for growth
and improvement in underperforming regions.
[14/8/2024, 1:17:25 pm] Ajay Sati: Check the sales measure , because your total sales is also giving different answer
[14/8/2024, 2:42:51 pm] ~ Rajesh Singha: Sir I checked sales measures, it has the same answer that you had 
This is for top 10 country total sales

[14/8/2024, 4:47:36 pm] ~ Akarsh: Sir this was the question where client wanted to know the 2016,17,18 customer churn. 

My question was when we used SELECTEDVALUE (Orders[Order date]. [Year]) in the above DAX why did it not show the customer churn for 2019.

But later I understood that it was a measure and measure aggregates dynamically with the visual and you had already filtered the visual to show only 2016,17,18 and that's why it did not show 2019 customer churn.
[14/8/2024, 4:58:34 pm] Ajay Sati: Here  we have filtered tha value and humne 2019 select ni kiya.

use either selectedvalue or  calculate.

[17/8/2024, 2:40:01 pm] Ajay Sati: Rankx is designed in a way that on which basis we should decide the rank should always be an aggregate..

This is the reason it's working for sales measure  and not for sum sales.

However in place of sum(sales) if you use calculate(sum(sales)) it will give the  desired output as  calculate function will first aggregate and then send value to rankx.

[18/8/2024, 5:07:33 pm] ~ $ID: Hello @918193802178   Sir,
Just wanted to cross check is this DAX for Mail-9 Q.1
For the year 2019 illustrate cumulative sum of sales for each month and show contribution to overall sales of 2019

For this I went ahead with 2 approaches
1.
Created 2 measures total sales and months contribution 

totalSales= CALCULATE (SUM(Sales[Sale]),ALL(Sales))

Monthscontribution =
Sales[SalesMeasure]/[totalSales]

Where SalesMeasure was
Calculate(Sum(Sales[Sale]))

And in table gave in the columns: Month, Sale, Monthscontribution ‎<This message was edited>
‎[18/8/2024, 5:07:48 pm] ~ $ID: ‎image omitted
[18/8/2024, 5:08:36 pm] ~ $ID: In method 2 I did slightly different approach 
I calculated a cumulative month sum of sales using the following measure
‎[18/8/2024, 5:09:06 pm] ~ $ID: ‎image omitted
[18/8/2024, 5:11:20 pm] ~ $ID: So here the total sum was matching with the approach and one more thing I forgot to mention I applied a filter on the visual based on year=2019 to show data only for that year
‎[18/8/2024, 5:11:44 pm] ~ $ID: ‎image omitted
[18/8/2024, 5:12:14 pm] ~ $ID: So are the two approaches correct and giving the required results as asked?
[18/8/2024, 5:14:56 pm] ~ $ID: And the other question was related to Mail-9 Q.2
(From Adventure works)

Calculate contribution of each sales representative to the overall sales for each year in percentage terms.

(Like in the example you have explained based on quantities sold)

What I have done is similar to previous question 
Created a new measure and the calculation is done based on Sum(Sales)

[18/8/2024, 5:17:29 pm] ~ $ID: So is this right or do I need to use number of quantities sold by an employee in a year

Create a new measure:
Quantity measure=
Calculate(Count(Quantity))

And use this in place of SalesMeasure?

The client requests the creation of a visual representation of sales data with a specific focus on country rankings. This visual should highlight and display only the countries that fall between the 11th and 19th positions based on their sales figures. The goal is to provide a clear understanding of the sales performance of countries that are mid-ranked in this range.

CountrySalesRank = RANKX(
ALL(Orders[Country]),
CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales])),
,
DESC,
DENSE

SalesForRankedCountries = CALCULATE(

In class while calculating cumulative sales for 2016-2019 when sir used FILTER the ouput was normal sum of sales for each year but when sir removed FILTER the output was cumulative sum. 
So how to decide when to use FILTER and when not? Also why did using FILTER in cumulative sum give normal sum?

[27/8/2024, 3:38:29 am] ~ suryakantabarik: Yes , I tried but that output is incorrect
[27/8/2024, 3:40:29 am] ~ Ignite: Your if statement is wrong
[27/8/2024, 3:40:46 am] ~ suryakantabarik: What?
[27/8/2024, 3:40:48 am] ~ Ignite: Show
[27/8/2024, 3:41:50 am] ~ suryakantabarik: What, if I visualised , it shows  me blank , why ?
[27/8/2024, 3:42:09 am] ~ Ignite: In if statement you need to pass 3 parameters 
1. conditions 
2. true result 
3. false result
[27/8/2024, 3:43:07 am] ~ suryakantabarik: I know, but if you have no false condition then what to do ?
[27/8/2024, 3:43:38 am] ~ Ignite: Then use blank() as false
[27/8/2024, 3:44:21 am] ~ suryakantabarik: Exactly,I have done that 
And the output is blank
[27/8/2024, 3:45:54 am] ~ Ignite: Visual ?

Go to formatting.

You can also choose to show decimals points, it will give same results as mine.
[27/8/2024, 3:55:49 am] Ajay Sati: What's the question.
[27/8/2024, 3:56:12 am] Ajay Sati: Why are you using filter and add column over here?
[27/8/2024, 3:56:26 am] ~ Ignite: I think the city rank on the basis of resellers count
[27/8/2024, 3:58:08 am] ~ suryakantabarik: The company is facing a strategic challenge in optimising market
efforts and resource allocation across different regions. To address
this, the company seeks to identify cities with the highest number
of resellers. However, the focus is specifically on those cities
ranked between the 5th and 15th positions in terms of reseller
count, draw a visual for the same for the client
[27/8/2024, 3:59:35 am] Ajay Sati: If you make a table  , which columns from data are you using in it??


Apart from this measure
[27/8/2024, 4:00:26 am] ~ suryakantabarik: Reseller table
City and reseller and reseller key ‎<This message was edited>

[27/8/2024, 10:34:03 pm] ~ Hasnain Ali: Hi @918193802178,

I am currently facing 2 issues with my Power Bi tenant.

1)- I have report which is connected to the data model hosted in Analysis Service.
Problem is, when I open this report in Power Bi desktop on my system, I can not see the DAX code of measures.
Neither it allows me to formate these measure in any way.

2)- other issue, we have a guest user in our organization, which we have added in our organization azure active directory and also given them Pro License for viewing reports.
Issue is that whenever they try to open the report, they get an error, stating that " Power Bi can not connect to data model in the Analysis Service", we have given them access as "Reader" in Analysis Service hosting said data model and given required access to workspace containing required Power Bi reports.

Please provide guidance regarding these queries if possible.

Regards.
[27/8/2024, 11:10:30 pm] Ajay Sati: 1- When you're working with a report in Power BI Desktop that's connected to an Analysis Services data model, you are likely using a Live Connection. A Live Connection allows Power BI Desktop to connect directly to an Analysis Services model but does not import the data into Power BI. 


2- What permission are you giving to entire AD , that your client is part of , in your workspace?
[27/8/2024, 11:11:36 pm] Ajay Sati: please share question
[27/8/2024, 11:28:06 pm] ~ Hasnain Ali: In the Power Bi Workspace, client is Given permission of "Contributor".

In the Analysis Service role of " Reader" have been assigned.
As for the AD workspace, I am not sure about it.

Can you guide where I can look that status up?
[27/8/2024, 11:31:16 pm] Ajay Sati: If client is contributor he can view the workspace however data model can't be edited by anyone one data is in power bi services.
[27/8/2024, 11:36:16 pm] ~ Hasnain Ali: but client should be able to view and interact with the report, right?
[27/8/2024, 11:36:31 pm] Ajay Sati: Yes even viewer can do that
[27/8/2024, 11:36:37 pm] Ajay Sati: How are you sharing that report
[27/8/2024, 11:36:50 pm] Ajay Sati: Via  mail or he is logging into power bi service.

[28/8/2024, 12:48:25 am] Ajay Sati: How do you share please tell the steps 

You open your workspace -> open your report-> then?

[28/8/2024, 1:05:30 am] Ajay Sati: Share it by creating app , and share that app link to your client, after logging in from his account he will be able to view the report..


If you don't have RLS in your report, I suggest you share via embedded link, to view this client even don't need any licence, or I'd, this will save your cost also.
[28/8/2024, 1:05:54 am] ~ Fighter: Guys could anyone suggest a good laptop

[28/8/2024, 1:32:03 am] ~ Monu Rathour: Hello sir i am new stu. and now i am watching  3 lecture what dataset you used in that lecture
[28/8/2024, 1:32:35 am] ~ Monu Rathour: how can i get that even about all the classes
[28/8/2024, 1:35:01 am] ~ Monu Rathour: sir please consider my querry
[28/8/2024, 1:37:18 am] ~ Rajesh Singha: global superstore dataset

[28/8/2024, 1:39:16 am] ~ Monu Rathour: will you share like this again and again
[28/8/2024, 1:42:31 am] ~ Rajesh Singha: dataset link has been given on the website
[28/8/2024, 1:43:50 am] ~ Monu Rathour: sir i am not able to see that could you please help me to find that 
and one question what about task or asignment
[28/8/2024, 1:46:18 am] ~ rajrathadia001: Sir 31 tareekh se phle kon kon se assignment submit krne ha name please ???
[28/8/2024, 1:53:07 am] ~ Rajesh Singha: Go Description of the recording video and in the resources section you will get the link to all of this
[28/8/2024, 1:53:12 am] Ajay Sati: this is the  dataset , download this excel file there are multiple  sheets in it.
[28/8/2024, 1:53:22 am] Ajay Sati: Adventure work
[28/8/2024, 2:25:07 am] ~ Sunshine: I know that qs has been asked, but again I was wondering for the laptop configuration to do the data science or data analyst  project at beginners to intermediate level. Budget is around 75 k to 100k INR.
[28/8/2024, 2:28:27 am] ~ Raj Kumar: Go with hp, simple search in this range, they automatically fulfill your requirement.
[28/8/2024, 2:29:45 am] ~ Sunshine: What should I prioritize more ,,
On RAM
Or processing speed?
[28/8/2024, 2:29:54 am] ~ Sunshine: Any idea?
[28/8/2024, 2:31:00 am] ~ Sufal: Are you planning to learn deep learning in future?
[28/8/2024, 2:31:15 am] ~ Sunshine: Yes
[28/8/2024, 2:32:16 am] ~ Sufal: consider getting a laptop with a decent gpu then
[28/8/2024, 2:33:23 am] ~ Pranay🎵🎶🎼: also ensure to use SSD instead of HDD and 16GB RAM is considered best for deep learning or machine learning
[28/8/2024, 2:33:32 am] ~ Sunshine: Please give some choices
[28/8/2024, 2:36:46 am] ~ Sufal: See this might be very unpopular opinion from my end and many people would disagree, but in my experience for pc windows is good and for laptops mac is good. If youre planning to do mostly data scienc/analysis any mid range laptop will get the job done, even 2 generations old processor will be good but for deep learning, gpu is a must, either u get a good gpu or if the system is old you pay subscription for cloud based gpu services.
[28/8/2024, 2:43:14 am] ~ Sunshine: Thanks

[6/9/2024, 5:34:16 pm] ~ Monu Rathour: In python if these are the data type like (  list, sets, dict, tupple etc ) *so* what is this  (  flot , string , integer, boolean  )

[6/9/2024, 5:37:55 pm] ~ Abhishek jha: Float, string, integer, boolean are all primitives. However, list, set, tuple and dict are not. They are containers. They are sequence types. They can further be classified as hashable or non hashable. Mutable and non mutable.
[6/9/2024, 5:39:19 pm] ~ Monu Rathour: and what about  flot , string , integer, boolean these
[6/9/2024, 5:40:26 pm] ~ Abhishek jha: These are not containers.
[6/9/2024, 5:41:06 pm] ~ Monu Rathour: you mean these are different different data type

[7/9/2024, 5:37:31 pm] ~ Megha Baliyan: @918193802178 I have doubt for the data modelling. I tried to create relationship however it is not making sense to me as with 3 tables I'm unable to find which is fact table, 1 table have many to one and another one is one to many. Also I want to ask that if we make one table after merging then the column will be 23 instead of one table with 20 columns and another table with 9 columns. As you said having more columns is costly so is this correct way or will this affect more in terms of industry project?
[7/9/2024, 5:45:27 pm] ~ @N!K€T: In companies, How do analysts get the data? Do they get access to the Database server or data engineer or does the IT devops team share it with the analysts?

Trust me guys, if someone follow this course dilligently(i mean- attending those lectures-solving those assignments and doubt session)that person will be at par 2/3 years experinced person.

I have joined many courses in the past but feels like mediocare or just basic things.

Almost all advanced level things get covered-ranging from power automate to fabric. ‎<This message was edited>

Also, I am connected to MySQL, but I want to get connected to the MS SQL Server. How can I do this?
‎[13/9/2024, 1:31:33 pm] ~ anil: ‎image omitted
[13/9/2024, 1:31:57 pm] Ajay Sati: You have changed the path from where initially you pulled the file.

This is the reason  it is showing error as when power bi is trying to set  refresh it can't find the source.
[13/9/2024, 1:32:37 pm] Ajay Sati: You can be only connected to those sources from where you have pulled data..

To connect to Ms SQL you have to pull data from there.
[13/9/2024, 1:34:37 pm] ~ anil: You mean to say when I worked on Power BI Dashboard and connected to one of the servers?
[13/9/2024, 1:34:58 pm] ~ anil: I mean, this can be corrected from Power BI Dashboard?
[13/9/2024, 1:40:46 pm] Ajay Sati: Yes

[13/9/2024, 1:47:48 pm] ~ anil: But, one thing I could remember that I did downloaded the connector for MySQL but I did not install it. So, how can it automatically get connected from Power BI Services?

And after I asked you for the resolution to my issue, I connected to the MS SQL Server, but again I am getting this same message that I am connected to MySQL. Will wait for sometime and see if it gets resolved.

[15/9/2024, 5:48:22 pm] ~ singladeepak211: Has sir shown all other sources to import data in power bi other than ms-excel?
[15/9/2024, 5:52:47 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Yes.. mysql, python, sql server, but not from cloud we need to see that.
[15/9/2024, 5:55:55 pm] ~ singladeepak211: And what about the data cleaning part ? If data we use is very messy then how to clean data before importing it to power bi?
[15/9/2024, 5:57:31 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Bro for that you need to learn pandas the data cleaning has 2 type of issue either the structural issue or the we can get the messy data so pandas provide different functionality to resolve the data cleaning stuff. Before importing in power bi
[15/9/2024, 5:59:10 pm] ~ singladeepak211: Means power bi has no power for the data cleaning part.? For that we have to learn python libraries 🥲
[15/9/2024, 5:59:17 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: And these 2 types is further classified where we need need to check whether our data follows the accuracy, consistency, completeness and whether our data is valid or not we need to check
[15/9/2024, 6:00:04 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Bro python m easy ho jata h m toh esa hi soch rha hu because agar hum power bi m data cleaning kare toh game m lang aana chaiye
[15/9/2024, 6:01:24 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Vase jo kaam m lang m hota h wo hum pandas m kr sakte h.. Ig I know pandas then why I learn m lang.. Ye depend karta h if you want to learn you can. But ultimate goal ye h hamara data clean hona chaiye pandas spark, m lang doesn't matter
[15/9/2024, 6:01:31 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: You can use any of these
[15/9/2024, 6:03:12 pm] ~ singladeepak211: I have my college admission data of last 5 year and my boss wants me to design a dashboard for that data and analysis the things . But that data is very messy. I learnt power bi from this course but before use that data in power bi I need to clean data ...that's major challenge for me right now 😪
[15/9/2024, 6:04:36 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Bro you need to use power query or pandas or spark to clean data.
[15/9/2024, 6:05:12 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Any of these things you need to use and in initial session sir has clearly mention that 70% of time is gone in data cleaning only.
[15/9/2024, 6:05:19 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: So I think you need to start.
[15/9/2024, 6:05:21 pm] ~ Vaibhav: With the help of power query you can achieve it.But, it is always recommended that to do the transformation as upstream ie.near to you original source before importing it in power bi.
[15/9/2024, 6:06:29 pm] ~ singladeepak211: Ok...thanks ...can anyone collaborate with me in the data cleaning part.? It would be great help for me
[15/9/2024, 6:06:58 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Yah I m interesting in that.
[15/9/2024, 6:12:04 pm] ~ Vaibhav: If you want to do in power bi- First do your data profiling-which column has duplicate values, null values and distinct values.

You can do this in power query editor.
[15/9/2024, 6:14:39 pm] ~ singladeepak211: I have 5 year data in same format so do I merge all the files and upload as single file or I ll upload 5 different files on power bi?
[15/9/2024, 6:17:20 pm] ~ Vaibhav: You can merge all those 5 files in a single file then import it in Power Bi Desktop.
[15/9/2024, 6:22:12 pm] ~ singladeepak211: Then apply data cleaning?
[15/9/2024, 6:23:26 pm] ~ Vaibhav: Yes.

For trends we use line chart ..

Creat a line chart for it,
x axis- year.
Yaxis- sum of qualified team.
[17/9/2024, 10:43:10 am] Ajay Sati: Here the value is count of teams that's the reason all values are same.


Rltnship considerations have  no role here .

We consider rltnship when we both the axis have values from different tables.

[17/9/2024, 4:37:36 pm] Ajay Sati: In this you have to see what's the team strategy of playing if they are playing knockout or non-knockout matches . You have to analyze their strategy in  both the time (before and after half time)


You analyse the strategy  (they play slow or fast) you need to find average goals for each team in knockout/non-knockout matches and in them also you have to analyze further on the basis of  time(half time/ full time)

[17/9/2024, 9:18:38 pm] ~ suryakantabarik: 👍
[17/9/2024, 9:19:39 pm] ~ Nizam: Will work fine sir, data acquisition is crucial n important step
[17/9/2024, 9:20:45 pm] ~ Ravina: What about those who don't have any prior knowledge of it... Will you please suggest any video for that
[17/9/2024, 9:21:51 pm] ~ Deepam-Personal: There is a playlists in campus x YouTube channel
[17/9/2024, 9:21:58 pm] Ajay Sati: I will try my best to explain each step in details with live code .

we just need HTML to understand the website code from where we have to extract data.

rest coding  will be done in python. ‎<This message was edited>

[17/9/2024, 9:28:52 pm] Ajay Sati: We have to portfolio is our face
[17/9/2024, 9:28:57 pm] Ajay Sati: Sure..
[17/9/2024, 9:29:28 pm] ~ Ravina: Thank you🙏
[17/9/2024, 9:52:12 pm] ~ Ankit: Sir, what about the students who don't even have knowledge of Python? 
Yh unfair ni hojyega? @918193802178
[17/9/2024, 9:52:30 pm] ~ Ankit: Not everyone will have enough time to learn Python as well
[17/9/2024, 9:52:50 pm] ~ Ankit: What's the point if we can't even answer Python-related questions in an interview?
[17/9/2024, 9:53:05 pm] ~ Ankit: Recruiter ko toh sir copy paste hi lagega
[17/9/2024, 9:53:25 pm] Ajay Sati: This is the reason I have asked everyone in the group , I need everyone opinion and then will go with majority
[17/9/2024, 9:55:25 pm] ~ Anchal Jain: We can do it in this way . The people who do not have the idea of python , they can directly take the  cleaned data and then work on that and those who have they can try from start ...this way it will be beneficial for both and In case later when learn python we can use this as reference
[17/9/2024, 9:55:48 pm] Ajay Sati: @919084409024  are you fine with it ?
[17/9/2024, 9:55:57 pm] Ajay Sati: Great suggestion
[17/9/2024, 9:56:49 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Sir still web scraping will take place at data strategy level?? In industry I mean this skills in demands??
[17/9/2024, 9:58:02 pm] Ajay Sati: It is in demand, it let you collect primary data.
[17/9/2024, 9:58:09 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Python is not the issue for me. I know it I am comfortable in both project like e Commerce one and this project also.
[17/9/2024, 9:58:47 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Although I have watched nitish sir video. He has explained all the things very well.
[17/9/2024, 9:59:18 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: We can move ahead.
[17/9/2024, 10:00:06 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: But i prefer that you will collect data from multiple source and combined it then performe some analysis. Instead of taking data from just one source. Can we do like that??
[17/9/2024, 10:00:29 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: And make the complete process automated.
[17/9/2024, 10:00:36 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: If possible
[17/9/2024, 10:01:05 pm] Ajay Sati: I will include as many source that allow me to scrap  data legally
[17/9/2024, 10:01:21 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Yah.. Sure.
[17/9/2024, 10:01:54 pm] Ajay Sati: scrapping had to be done manually for each site, it cant be automated.
every website have different HTML working at backend.
[17/9/2024, 10:02:39 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: Yah but can't we schedule the python script so that we don't have to run it again and again to fetch the data.
[17/9/2024, 10:02:57 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: From platform I think we can use Databrick to do that.
[17/9/2024, 10:03:20 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: It will give us facilities to automate pipeline.
[17/9/2024, 10:03:39 pm] Ajay Sati: nope , scheduling will pull data each time from website  , this will increase  load on Refresh and gateway.
[17/9/2024, 10:03:51 pm] Ajay Sati: that will be too advance for everyone
[17/9/2024, 10:06:23 pm] ~ Ankit: Sir apko jaisa thik lge lekin
 aise dataset par kam krna jo python vale bhi ni unke portfolio mein value add kr sake aur resume ki weightage bade @918193802178
[17/9/2024, 10:06:39 pm] Ajay Sati: *This group is for everyone , this course is for everyone*

Please come up with your ideas and suggestions , we will work on the one  that is in best interest with everyone.
we have learned to get data from SQL, python , Excel , web, automate the flow  etc.
We have done almost all major components.

Now I want to add something new, please come up with ideas. ‎<This message was edited>
[17/9/2024, 10:06:48 pm] Ajay Sati: I will figure some way out
[17/9/2024, 10:09:30 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: I think web scraping is a good idea.. Which you were suggesting.. But recruiter definitely ask whether this process is automated or not. Any project in which we automate the flow. I like the way we did financial data analysis.
[17/9/2024, 10:10:21 pm] ~ || The Gamer ||: If in anyway we can automate the pipeline using some tools in web scraping if possible.
[17/9/2024, 10:48:34 pm] ~ shubham singh616: Sir web scrapping will add value for us so I think you can go for it.
[17/9/2024, 11:17:19 pm] ~ Anil: Sir, is it possible to scrap instagram data, in my company we have to scrap insta data for data analysis could you guide?

[19/9/2024, 5:33:10 pm] Ajay Sati: give it condition that if nothing is selected it should show (what to show )

[20/9/2024, 12:02:49 am] Ajay Sati: Isfiltred use karo where we are selecting value of  parameters.

[20/9/2024, 1:04:37 am] Ajay Sati: Jo variable hai usme aapki  average puri values store hai for each gender .

And in if condition we are filtering on the basis of context.


So for each row I am checking if average is more than income of that row..
That that person is under average.
[20/9/2024, 1:05:24 am] Ajay Sati: It's right but written in complex way .
[20/9/2024, 1:06:01 am] ~ Monu Rathour: but sir apne agg. func. lagaya hai after calculate
[20/9/2024, 1:06:12 am] ~ Monu Rathour: isme confusion hai sir

[20/9/2024, 1:06:34 am] ~ Ignite: I tried 2 3 ways but wo false result me referee names show nhi kr raha
[20/9/2024, 1:06:55 am] Ajay Sati: We use the calculated function to calculate some aggregate

I mean what issue are you facing..
[20/9/2024, 1:10:04 am] Ajay Sati: Our problem Was to compare average income for each gender and then. Compare each person income to the particular gender average income.


So in the above code we calculated average for each gender .

Using the calculated function and  then storing values of the calculated function in a variable.
[20/9/2024, 1:11:12 am] Ajay Sati: We used calculated function because hume pure data ka average ni chaiya..
We need average after filtering the data .


And calculate function is used to calculate aggregate based on some filter
[20/9/2024, 1:19:21 am] ~ Ignite: Sir
[20/9/2024, 1:19:22 am] ~ Ignite: Ye dax samaj nahi araha, Isme agar parameter filter nhi horaha toh "hello" show krna chahiye but wo referee names kaise show kr raha hai , unexpected correct result for me
[20/9/2024, 1:20:28 am] ~ Ignite: If I replace hello with blank it is showing blank rows in visual

[20/9/2024, 1:24:54 am] ~ Ignite: Bhai wo male value fixed hai
[20/9/2024, 1:26:13 am] Ajay Sati: And that is fixed 


And in if condition I am comparing each row value to  the value stored in male.

Male  variables ma average income hai and  agar  male varibale ki  value jada hoei to automatically us row ma jo value hai wo under average ho gayi
[20/9/2024, 1:26:59 am] ~ Ignite: Male value pure column ki average calculate kar raha hai jara gender male h , toh male = 50000 aise hoga wo same for female = 51000 then we are comparing these two values each row
[20/9/2024, 1:28:03 am] Ajay Sati: Will check it..
[20/9/2024, 1:28:21 am] ~ Ignite: Ok sir thank you

[20/9/2024, 3:31:26 pm] ~ Ignite: Create new column, compare home team goals and away team goals , if home team goals is more then win else lose
[20/9/2024, 3:34:37 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: Ok, will try that. Thanks
[20/9/2024, 3:45:29 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: I have a problem with about 186 records now where the Goals scored are equal, BUT, its not a Draw, as in 'Win Conditions' few records they have mentioned Winning Teams. How to extract those names from 'Win Conditions'
[20/9/2024, 3:46:44 pm] ~ Ignite: Which problem you are solving ?
[20/9/2024, 3:47:33 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: No i just was trying to figure out, Winning Team for ALL World Cup Matches. Not a specific problem.
[20/9/2024, 3:48:52 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: Out of the 186 Records/Rows where its a Draw, there are 26 Records for which i can manually find using Excel, the Winning Team, by going through each of 186 records to pin point winning Team.
[20/9/2024, 3:55:50 pm] ~ Ignite: Ok I got it
[20/9/2024, 3:56:11 pm] ~ Ignite: You are talking about penalties right
[20/9/2024, 3:59:46 pm] ~ Ignite: But there are only 26 records of penalties I think you can extract that in power query and create penalty column
[20/9/2024, 4:00:21 pm] ~ Ignite: Then you can use if function to compare penalties
[20/9/2024, 4:01:32 pm] ~ Ignite: Still 160 rows are blank so they will give results as draw
[20/9/2024, 4:05:47 pm] Ajay Sati: Didn't got the problem.

Plesse explain  it again.
[20/9/2024, 4:05:51 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: Yes, i managed for rest using Excel. But as you mentioned, 171 records are DRAW and in them 4 has no clear winner name mentioned.

[20/9/2024, 4:08:26 pm] ~ Ignite: If you notice other records the first is home team goals and other one is away team goals
[20/9/2024, 4:09:17 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: Oh, thanks.
[20/9/2024, 4:27:53 pm] ~ Diwaker Tanwar: @918193802178 Order placed for total different types of services (55K). However bill raised monthly based on actual execution. Hence theses bill are called RA(running bills) So far we have received 13 No's RA bill for which data mapped against initial order. For example in RA-1 out of 55K services 3K services are started hence in RA-1 Total bill raised for 3K activities. In next month let say 5K services done. Like wise we have received totally 13 No's bills for which data mapped in 13 different columns. Now we have to evaluate and show a matrix visual in which row contains RA-1,RA-2, RA-3 and so on and in column we have punch total amount of bill raised in respective RA bill

[21/9/2024, 8:01:01 pm] ~ $ID: Hi everyone,
I have just started solving the FIFA assignment 

Needed some cross check if I am going the right way

Have designed visuals for Q1 to Q3

[21/9/2024, 8:01:43 pm] ~ $ID: For the cards as we had to find total made use of sum 
For Q3
I created a summarised table and two measures
‎[21/9/2024, 8:02:49 pm] ~ $ID: ‎image omitted
‎[21/9/2024, 8:02:52 pm] ~ $ID: ‎image omitted

[21/9/2024, 8:08:46 pm] ~ $ID: Is this the correct or am I wrong?

And for Q4 we have to plot a visual how has the number of teams qualified over years changed
So as per my understanding here:
Here the two columns from WorldCups table will be useful that are QualifiedTeams and Year.
Then for the visual I was thinking of going with Line chart 📈 
So there in Xaxis: Year
Yaxis: Qualified Teams (count) but this gives a straight line
‎[21/9/2024, 8:09:48 pm] ~ $ID: ‎image omitted
[21/9/2024, 8:13:32 pm] ~ $ID: @918193802178 Sir and others just help me if I am wrong here
[21/9/2024, 8:16:20 pm] ~ $ID: (if it was covered in any of the doubt sessions do let me know I will check that out 🙂)
[21/9/2024, 8:39:08 pm] ~ $ID: For Q3 I am not sure whether I am right 
So the second approach that I was thinking is instead of using summarised table if I use DAX to find how many times a country has won may work
Like

We have data directly present in world cup table.

[22/9/2024, 4:18:27 am] ~ Sufal: Recently, we've received reports regarding interruptions in accessing our website and lagging videos, which we understand can be frustrating while trying to focus on your studies.

After investigating the issue with our tech team, we've identified a solution that should help resolve these disruptions. It involves flushing the DNS (Domain Name System) cache on your devices. Below, we've outlined step-by-step instructions tailored for both Windows and macOS systems:

DNS Flush - Windows System:
Open Command Prompt.
In the command prompt window, type: ipconfig/flushdns
Press Enter.
DNS Flush is successful, now try accessing the course.
DNS Flush - macOS System:
Open Terminal.
In the terminal window, type the appropriate command based on your macOS version (see below).
Press Enter.
After typing the command and hitting enter, there will be a prompt for entering your computer's password.
Keep in mind that when you are typing your password, you will not be able to view what you are typing – not even any asterisks.

It appears as though nothing is happening, but rest assured that something is. Once you have entered your password and hit enter, you will not see a message indicating that the process is complete. Instead, you will view a new terminal prompt. This means that the DNS Flush is successful, and now try accessing the course.

For macOS versions:

macOS 12 (Monterey): sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
macOS 11 (Big Sur): sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and older: Please refer to the respective command listed above.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused and sincerely hope that this solution resolves the issues you've encountered. 

If you continue to experience difficulties accessing the course or encounter any other technical issues, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. Your feedback is crucial in ensuring a seamless learning experience for all.

Thank you for your patience and understanding.

Best regards,
CampusX Team

[22/9/2024, 5:31:31 pm] Ajay Sati: I was planning that only.

But the HTML codes of these websites are complex, having paginations and duplicate class.
Moreover I hitted indeed website two times and the third time they blocked  my laptop IP address, so  we can't even automate the process.......

The same case was with naukri.com too.
[22/9/2024, 5:32:15 pm] ~ Kushagra: Ok no problem sir.

[28/9/2024, 3:44:11 pm] Ajay Sati: It will be deleted.

As when you refresh , your source will be hit and data will be taken from there.


As files are delted from there , files will not be  shown in power BI

[29/9/2024, 2:47:08 pm] ~ Vijay Bhise: Yesterday's Navneet gave a good insight regarding looking for job in Data Science. Do not just focus on IT companies ONLY initially. Decide which sector or domain you wish to make career in. Say you wish to do it in Fintech, then do a good 1-2 project in Fintech (Eg Personal banking) using data from Kaggle and put in your portfolio. Then visit small banks in your city and approach their management showing your project and express to do a Data Analysis for their real data and most importantly give them INSIGHTS on which the Management can act. Once you get experience in such small company but real domain knowledge, can target for big companies in that domain. Thanks to Ajay & Navneet for this sessions.

Sir I have a question regarding carrier paths related to data analyst.

Can you please summarize difference in responsibilities of Data analyst and Data engineer?

What are the required skills to switch from data analyst to data engineering side?

Lastly, as a data analyst how much should we be familiar with data engineering side and is there a possibility for introduction of a data engineering learning pathway on the website?

I started my DSMP Courser recently. 

I just want to know What is the best way to watch the online lectures. 

Should I make notes parallelly or should I practice coding parallelly or I should just listen carefully and practice later or watch video twice or something else . Please help me with best of your experience 🙏.
[23/10/2024, 2:29:24 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: Watch carefully 

Make notes side by side

And make detailed notes
[23/10/2024, 2:32:11 am] ~ Raj Gaurav: What about coding
[23/10/2024, 2:32:21 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: After video
[23/10/2024, 2:32:25 am] ~ Raj Gaurav: Should I practice later or side by side
[23/10/2024, 2:32:41 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: Cover each detail when making notes.

This is my way
[23/10/2024, 2:33:00 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: After watching video 

Or jisme.aap comfortable ho
[23/10/2024, 2:33:33 am] ~ Raj Gaurav: I will make myself comfortable. Ap batao best tarika kya hai
[23/10/2024, 2:34:53 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: My way

Watch + notes + code (sometime side by side/ sometimes after watching video)

Coding part depends upon the topic
[23/10/2024, 2:35:12 am] ~ Raj Gaurav: Okay
[23/10/2024, 2:35:27 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: Yess

[23/10/2024, 2:36:30 am] ~ Mohd Maaz: If you are watching conceptual video like any concept then do the coding partt at end

If making any project then side by side

I need one help to make my model more dynamic 
Currently I am using parameters 

I am using onedrive for source file 
I have shared the pbix file with my colleagues 
But when the anyone open file
 , we get error because of file path 
So I use parameters to make dynamic 
Now as per my colleague ID we have to select parameter then issue fix
But I want when anyone of my colleague open that file it automatically takes his ID .

If anyone knows how to do that let me know 


By using measure i am able to get that , but the problem is in power query I can not import that , so not helpful ‎<This message was edited>

Feature	IF	SWITCH
Purpose	Evaluates a single condition.	Evaluates multiple conditions or values.
Simplicity	Simple "if-else" logic.	Reduces complexity in multi-condition scenarios.
Readability	Becomes harder to read with nesting.	Easier to manage with multiple conditions.
Default Value	No direct default value.	Allows a default value for unmatched cases.
Performance	May be less efficient if nested.	More efficient for multiple evaluations.

[25/11/2024, 6:51:43 am] ~ Tariq: Please be candid in your response
[25/11/2024, 7:20:46 am] ~ Harry: I won’t buy the course personally, but if you ask me what attracted me to this course would just be projects. Still that doesn’t motivate me to get this new course.
Perhaps the audience of this new course are people new to Data and for them this course is great.
Someone mentioned it’s missing cloud and I 100% agree with them.
Even as a beginner some exposure of Azure/AWS/GCP would be very beneficial.
Having Said that I would understand if CampusX charges more to add cloud in this course.
Maybe that’s the trade off because CampusX does keep fees low.
Anyways that’s my 2 cents
[25/11/2024, 7:22:48 am] ~ Tariq: Thank you Harry for the insights can not agree more

I have a query: Is it possible to write all our logic in SQL instead of using DAX or measures and then use those SQL queries directly in Power BI?
[14/12/2024, 5:32:31 am] ~ Rahul Kumar: It is not possible

[14/12/2024, 10:06:00 am] ~ SUSHANT KASHYAP: Yes it’s possible but upto certain limits
[14/12/2024, 10:07:33 am] ~ SUSHANT KASHYAP: Like you can create static data out of your database using sql and can do manupulation, add new columns, create new measures as per your needs
[14/12/2024, 10:08:52 am] ~ SUSHANT KASHYAP: You are anyhow connecting it with power bi at the end so you can create dynamic report out of it using power bi. If still you need anything extra in your model you can create if on the fly as well
[14/12/2024, 10:09:34 am] ~ SUSHANT KASHYAP: This is what generally happens in the organisation’s.
